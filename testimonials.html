                            "Kate did a wonderful job in helping me to purge and organize my basement. She has a very gentle manner and is easy to work with.  Taking my lead, she assisted me in organizing redundant items for recycling, donating and garbage. Kate provided the service of removing the items for donation so that anything of value could be reused. She helped me in recognizing that some sentimental items could have a photo taken as a memory, particularly since the item was not going to be put on a wall or a shelf; why keep it in a box?  She had good ideas for storage solutions such as shelving, etc. Together we identified projects; personal things that I need to go through and deal with.  I found that before Kate came I was doing some of this work on my own however I was only shifting things around so with her help I was able to make good decisions. When she left I had no regrets. I would highly recommend Kate’s services for organizing and simplifying!  I guarantee you will feel a sense of lightness and accomplishment."

On the day of the move, she was at the new place and guided the movers as to where everything was to go.  This made unpacking a breeze.  Her methodical approach made the move seamless.  By the next day even the pictures were hung."

                        "Kate is an organizing professional extraordinaire!  She turned an emotionally daunting task into an efficient and uplifting process.  Her ability to deal with ‘stuff’ and the emotions tied to that ‘stuff’ is truly a gift.  With patience, objectivity and compassion, Kate moved me forward in letting go of so many things tied to my past by questioning the degree of usefulness, joyfulness and/or heaviness in my life.  She also helped me reframe my attachment to things by discovering new ways to hold on to the memories versus to the items themselves."

                        <p>
                            In my personal case I had accumulated so many heirlooms from my Grandparents, my parents and my daughter’s childhood. In my mind letting them go was like losing special parts of my life, fearful that I would forget them.  Instead, I took pictures and held on to the most special pieces and was able to find new uses for them in my home whether on display or stored in a more productive and accessible way.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            "From the get go, Kate took the time to understand what I valued as a person and what I wanted to achieve from the organizing process, which made partnering with her and making decisions so much easier.  My 12 x 20 foot storage room has been transformed from a piled high room of boxes and belongings into a newly renovated guest room.  The décor of that room is still in process, but Kate’s “get it done” energy was the catalyst I needed to achieve my own vision. I should add that Kate not only helped me sort and re-store things uniquely – she took my donation items away with her and dropped them off for me which enabled me to feel less burdened by those additional completion steps.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I highly recommend Kate to help with any household projects ranging from small decluttering and organization projects to large initiatives that require multiple rooms or spaces.  She will work diligently and keep the big picture vision in mind while continually consulting with the client on their needs and comfort level.  Kate will make things happen in a high-quality and efficient way!

                        I'm a person who likes a tidy kitchen.  But don't open a cupboard door or you might encounter an avalanche of disorganization.

                            At least that was the case until I hired Kate Johnston of Organize & Simplify.  She came in and whipped my kitchen into shape in an efficient and cheerful manner.  She just sees things differently and knows how to apply her organizational skills and project management expertise to help unclutter your life.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            Months later - my kitchen is still organized which is a testament to the systems Kate put in place.  Thank you Kate - it's now safe to open a cupboard in my kitchen.  Now, on to my bedroom closet?
